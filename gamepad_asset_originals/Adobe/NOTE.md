These psd files were converted from the original Affinity Designer file. You may have mixed luck editing it outside of Photoshop. I've had good luck opening it on photopea.com and exporting svg from there, as photoshop seems to have lost svg export capability. It may be easier to import one of the SVGs from the svg folder into your vector graphics program instead. The SVG and PSD retain the layer names (corresponding to the SVG element IDs and classes), while the PDF appears to have lost them.
